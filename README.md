# Understanding SVD and PCA: From Theory to Code

This repo serves as a guide to understand SVD and its application to PCA for my students. It bridges the gap between the underlying maths with a readable Python implementation.

## Math
`math.md` provides a step-by-step explanation of singular value decomposition. It is meant to be accessible and easily followed (for those who are motivated).

## Code
`svd.py` is a pure numpy implementation of the concepts discussed in the math guide. It is meant to be demonstrative and easily picked apart.
